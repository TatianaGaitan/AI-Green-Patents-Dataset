This dataset combines two existing sources: the Artificial Intelligence Patent Dataset (AIPD) and the IPC/WIPO Green Inventory, drawing from the USPTO Bulk Patent Data. The datasets construction and reclassification provide insights into the intersection of AI and environmental technologies, enabling cross-sectoral and longitudinal analysis from 1976 to 2023. It contains 10,655 unique patents, including information on the primary inventor, the first IPC green classification, and the patent abstract. This resource also offers valuable perspectives on the twin transition, the parallel shift toward digitalisation and sustainability.

### Categories: 
General Patent Information: Includes patent IDs, publication dates, application numbers, and other metadata.

IPC Classification: Provides detailed IPC classification data, including sections, classes, subclasses, main groups, subgroups, and classification statuses.

AI Classification: Contains columns for each of the eight AI technologies, including scores for AI component presence and a general AI score.
 1. Knowledge Processing: Methods to represent and derive facts about the world.
 2.	Speech: Techniques for understanding words from acoustic signals.
 3.	AI Hardware: Physical systems implementing AI software.
 4.	Evolutionary Computation: Algorithms inspired by natural evolution.
 5.	Natural Language Processing: Understanding data encoded in human language.
 6.	Machine Learning: Includes neural networks, adaptive systems, and probabilistic models.
 7.	Computer Vision: Extracting information from visual inputs.
 8.	Planning/Control: Developing and executing plans to achieve goals.

Inventor Information: Lists inventor IDs, names, gender, and location data, facilitating demographic and geographic analyses of innovation.

Abstract: Abstract of each patent.
